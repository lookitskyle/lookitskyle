This cocktail featured in *So Red the Nose, or Breath in the Afternoon*, published in 1935. This recipe was the writer Ernest Hemmingway’s contribution to the book. It is said that Hemmingway created this cocktail after enjoying absinthe whilst in France. 

Whilst Hemmingway opted to use Champagne, this isn't in everyone's budget, so I've opted to use prosecco as a cheaper alternative!

Fun Fact: The cocktail shares a name with Hemmingway’s 1932 book about Spanish bullfighting.
