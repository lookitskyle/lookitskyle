The caipiroska is a variant of the Brazilian caipirinha that is made with vodka instead of cacha√ßa. It is extremely popular in Brazil, where it is believed to have been created. Caipiroskas can be adapted in many different ways and instead of the traditional caipiroska, here is a strawberry flavoured variation!

## Ingredients

60ml vodka

1/2 lime, cut in half

2 tsp of brown sugar

50g strawberries, sliced

Crushed ice

## Method

In your glass, muddle the lime and the brown sugar.

Add the strawberries and continue to muddle the mixture.

Add enough crushed ice to fill the glass.

Top with the vodka and enjoy!
