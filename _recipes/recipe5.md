The caipiroska is a variant of the Brazilian caipirinha that is made with vodka instead of cacha√ßa. It is extremely popular in Brazil, where it is believed to have been created. Caipiroskas can be adapted in many different ways and instead of the traditional caipiroska, here is a strawberry flavoured variation!
