Antarctica is mainly populated by research scientists. The continent has no indigenous people due to the harsh terrain and weather conditions it experiences and even now the population stands around a minute 4,000, but only during the warmer months of the year.

This cocktail pays homage to the wintery conditions that Antarctica experiences all year round. It’s simply impossible to look at this cocktail without being reminded of snow and ice!

## Ingredients

120ml coconut cream

120ml blue curaçao

120ml white rum

480g ice

60g white or blue sugar crystals

Water

A small dish

A blender

## Method

Put the coconut cream, ice, and the rum into the blender and blend until a consistently smooth texture is achieved.

Take your glasses and dip the edges into a 1/4 inch of water, followed by dipping them into the dish filled with sugar crystals. 

Pour 1/4 of the mixture into each glass and enjoy!
