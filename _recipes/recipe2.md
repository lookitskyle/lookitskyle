Antarctica is mainly populated by research scientists. The continent has no indigenous people due to the harsh terrain and weather conditions it experiences and even now the population stands around a minute 4,000, but only during the warmer months of the year. 

This cocktail pays homage to the wintery conditions that Antarctica experiences all year round. Itâ€™s simply impossible to look at this cocktail without being reminded of snow and ice!
