I have found myself at a bit of a crossroads recently, casting your sights upon the future is never an easy task. The idea of graduating and finishing my time at uni has been a difficult one for me to grasp. As I entered my third and final year (during a pandemic), I was in complete denial of just how short an academic year is. I constantly threw out phrases like ‘I still have time’ or ‘I don’t need to think about the future’, all to mask the very real realities that lay ahead. Yes, obviously I thought at times about what I was going to do once I finish my Bachelors, however the uncertainty I felt around the subject would quickly shut down those thoughts! 

My problem was (and is still to a large extent) that I simply didn’t know what I wanted to do next.

As anyone who has tasted independence will understand, I simply refuse to lose that progress I have made over the last three years, just to return to my small village. Of course, this is easier said than done! Finding housing (not as a student anymore!), finding the financial security to pay rent and bills, finding the work, and figuring out the best way to convince my parents of my plans… none of it is easy in any way shape or form! Especially when you’re trying to enter an industry as selective as Publishing.

After having spent the last sixteen years of my life in some form of education; unsurprisingly I am absolutely exhausted of the concept of education. Furthermore, I don’t want to pursue any higher educational pursuits at this moment in time. Yet I found myself clinging to the thought of completing a Masters program. Reality soon hit and I realised that studying a Masters was just a way to delay reality: what do I do next? 

This pandemic hasn’t much helped either - when you graduate you are grappling with the most uncertain time of your life, the graduates of post 2020 definitely could have done without even more uncertainty! I don’t know about you, but this pandemic has felt very out of time and space, as though after this pandemic we’re all magically going to be in April 2020? Ok, ok, I’m not dumb, I do know that isn’t how any of this works, but I’d be lying if I haven’t pretended that is how it works when I’ve thought about post-University life!

Even at the time of writing this blog post… I still haven’t figured out what I want to do next. In my mind it’s simply a problem for later me hmm… that sounds very like my approach to deadlines throughout university haha! 

For now though... this is the end of my posting! Perhaps I'll end up back here in months to come - we'll just have to wait and see.

Farewell~
